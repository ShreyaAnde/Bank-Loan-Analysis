# 📊 Bank Loan Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **Bank Loan Data Analysis** for monitoring and evaluating the performance of a financial institution’s loan portfolio. The goal is to track loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, interest rates, and borrower profiles using **Python, SQL, and Power BI**.  

The project provides **actionable insights** through interactive dashboards, enabling banks to make informed decisions about lending, repayments, and risk management.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
- **SQL** – Data extraction, transformation, and querying from relational databases.  
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard and visualization reporting.

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Banks need to understand and monitor the performance of loans to **reduce risks** and **maximize returns**. This project answers:  

1. How many loans were applied and funded over time?  
2. How much has been received back from borrowers?  
3. What are the **Good vs. Bad Loan ratios**?  
4. How do loan purposes, borrower employment length, and home ownership affect loan performance?  
5. Which regions show higher or lower lending activity?

- **Total Loan Applications**  
- **Total Funded Amount**  
- **Total Amount Received**  
- **Average Interest Rate**  
- **Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio**  
- **Good Loan % vs. Bad Loan %**

## 🔎 Findings & Results  

1. **Loan Applications & Funding**  
   - Total Applications: **~39K**  
   - Total Funded Amount: **~$435M**  
   - Total Amount Received: **~$473M**  

2. **Interest Rate & Borrower Health**  
   - Average Interest Rate: **~12%**  
   - Average DTI Ratio: **~13%**  

3. **Good vs. Bad Loans**  
   - Good Loans: **87% of applications (~26.4K loans)**  
   - Bad Loans: **13% of applications (~4.1K loans)**  
   - ✅ Repayments from Good Loans exceed funded amounts → Portfolio is healthy.  

4. **Loan Purpose**  
   - **Debt Consolidation** dominates, followed by **Credit Card** and **Home Improvement**.  

5. **Regional Insights**  
   - Higher loan volumes in **highly populated states**.  
   - Lower lending activity in Midwest & South regions.  

6. **Borrower Profile**  
   - **Mortgage/Rent** borrowers dominate.  
   - Borrowers with **10+ years employment** contribute the highest loan amounts.  

7. **Trends**  
   - Seasonal spikes in loan issuance (~April–May).  
   - Repayment cycles align with issuance trends.  

---

## ✅ Business Impact  
- Provides **clear visibility** into portfolio health.  
- Helps in **identifying high-risk borrowers**.  
- Supports **data-driven lending and collection strategies**.  
- Improves **profitability by reducing default risks**.  

---

## 💡 Recommendations  
1. Focus lending on **borrowers with stable employment** (5+ years).  
2. Closely monitor **Debt Consolidation loans**, as they form the largest segment.  
3. Implement **regional risk-based pricing** in states with higher defaults.  
4. Strengthen **loan recovery strategies** for the 13% bad loans.
